    <h3>Stock Market Prediction</h3>
  </a>
  <p>This project is a mix of learning time-series ML, testing out my new GPU, and maybe making some money with minimal effort. I aim to predict future stock prices using historical data with an LSTM-based model...</p>

[comment]: <> (To display README excerpts and images, you'll need to copy over a portion of each project's README into projects.md, and download the first image, or use a URL if it’s hosted online. GitHub doesn’t support dynamic embedding of GitHub API data on Pages without JavaScript, so manual excerpts are a workaround for keeping things simple. For a more automated approach with dynamic README content, consider deploying on platforms like Netlify or Vercel that support serverless functions and JavaScript, allowing you to pull content dynamically from GitHub’s API.)
