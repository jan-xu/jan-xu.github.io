To create custom clickable panels that take you to a link, you can use HTML and Markdown syntax. Here's an example:

```markdown
[Click me](https://example.com){: .panel}
```

This will create a clickable panel with the text "Click me" that redirects to the URL "https://example.com". You can customize the appearance of the panel using CSS.

Remember to replace "https://example.com" with the actual URL you want to link to.
