I'm Jan, a Machine Learning / Software / Research Engineer, a self-prescribed nerd and a chronic problem-solver. I'm passionate about exploring the vast ML research space and writing beautiful code with the end goal of creating a better world for all of us.

My previous position was Staff Research Engineer at [Deep Render](https://www.deeprender.ai), an AI start-up developing state-of-the-art video compression codecs. In a team composed by some of the most talented researchers I've had the fortune of working with, we successfully built the world's first AI-based video codec that runs _HD (1080p) encoding **and** decoding in real-time_ on edge devices (smartphones and laptops).

My university degree was an MEng in Civil Engineering from Imperial College London, with a year abroad at UC Berkeley (which, incidentally, piqued my interest for ML).
